# React App Portfolio

## Description

This portfolio uses React technology to render only dynamic information when necessary. When you click on the various sections, the static information does not change, but only the "cards" of information that need to be changed for re-rendering.

## Usage
You can launch the index.html in the web browser and navigate using the tabs on the navigation bar.

## Contributors
Aaron Styza is the sole contributor for this project.
